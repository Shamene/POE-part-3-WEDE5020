      <h2>Sofas & Lounge Chairs — Sculptural Comfort</h2>

      <article class="product" id="tigerwood-armchair">
        <h3>The Tigerwood Armchair</h3>
        <img src="_images/soaps_3.jpg" alt="Tigerwood Armchair image placeholder" />
        <p>
          Commanding presence meets comfort. This armchair blends the raw strength of tiger-like patterns carved into rich wood with plush cream cushions. Its broad,
          sculptural arms make it not just a seat but a throne for modern living spaces. A piece that roars with personality while holding onto elegance.
        </p>

      <article class="product" id="twin-tiger-set">
        <h3>The Twin Tiger Set</h3>
        <img src="_images/soaps_4.jpg" alt="Twin Tiger Set image placeholder" />
        <p>
          Designed for both intimacy and drama, this set of two tiger-patterned chairs with a matching ottoman is perfect for conversational corners. The deep wood
          frame grounds the design, while the fabric evokes the wild beauty of untamed landscapes. Luxurious, yet inviting — a pair that turns any room into a private lounge.
        </p>

        <h3>The Ivory Crest Sofa</h3>
        <img src="_images/soaps_5.jpg" alt="Ivory Crest Sofa image placeholder" />
        <p>
          This rounded armchair embodies softness and strength in perfect balance. Covered in creamy fur-like upholstery with subtle animal markings, it feels like a blend
          of modern luxury and primal design. The deep seat invites relaxation, while the bold shape makes it a sculptural centerpiece.

        <h3>The Outdoor Safari Loungers</h3>
        <img src="_images/soaps_10.jpg" alt=alt="Outdoor Safari Loungers image placeholder" />
        <p>
          For the outdoors but designed like art. These lounge chairs carry the same bold tiger-print design as the twin indoor set, but reimagined for open-air living.
          Built for relaxation under the sun, they celebrate nature with patterns that honor the wild — making your garden or patio an extension of luxury.

        <p>
          This piece is a love letter to movement in wood. Hand-carved swooping patterns ripple across its frame, almost like flowing water frozen in time.
          Every curve is intentional, creating a cupboard that doesn’t just hold objects — it tells a story of rhythm and craftsmanship. Perfect for displaying
          vases, books, or statement art pieces, it’s a functional sculpture for your home.

        <p>
          Luxury meets bold design. The doors of this cupboard shimmer with green glass panels that evoke the deep glow of emeralds. Against the rich wooden frame,

          to radiate elegance and prestige.

        <p>
          Raw. Natural. Striking. This cupboard is carved to resemble a real tree branch, as though nature itself was transformed into furniture. Its organic form
          and textured finish celebrate the beauty of imperfection and the wildness of the earth. A grounding piece that brings nature’s soul into your interior.
