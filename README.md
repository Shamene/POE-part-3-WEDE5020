 ## Afri Furniture & Interior – Website README

## Project Overview

Afri Furniture & Interior is a modern web project that celebrates African luxury, culture, and craftsmanship.
This website was designed to showcase handcrafted furniture, interior design services, and art inspired by African heritage. It aims to create a beautiful online experience that feels professional, inviting, and proudly rooted in African identity.



## Website Structure

## The website is made up of five main HTML pages and one main CSS file:
	•	index.html – Homepage with hero section, product categories, top sellers, and key highlights.
	•	about.html – About page telling the story and purpose behind Afri Furniture & Interior.
	•	products_services.html – Page listing products (sofas, cupboards, art, décor) and interior design services.
	•	gallery.html – Image gallery showing completed projects and designs.
	•	contact_us.html – Contact form and business details for communication.
	•	style.css – One merged stylesheet controlling the look of all pages (colors, fonts, layout, responsiveness, etc.).



## Main Goals

## The main goals of this project were to:
	•	Build a fully working multi-page website using HTML and CSS.
	•	Reflect African-inspired design through layout, colors, and imagery.
	•	Create clean, consistent navigation between all pages.
	•	Apply responsive design so it works well on different screen sizes.
	•	Add SEO (Search Engine Optimization) meta tags for every page.
	•	Include clear, plain-English comments throughout all code to explain what each section does.



## Design Choices
	•	Color palette: Gold and deep navy were used to represent luxury and heritage.
	•	Typography: A modern sans-serif font was chosen for readability and elegance.
	•	Layout: Clean grids and large imagery highlight the brand’s premium aesthetic.
	•	Navigation: Sticky header and mobile-friendly menu make it easy to browse.
	•	Accessibility: All images include alt text to describe content.


## Developer’s Reflection

During Part 3, I learned how to make my website more professional by improving its structure and readability. I added SEO meta tags for each page and wrote clear comments so that anyone can understand the purpose of each section in my code.
I also merged all my CSS into one main file, which made it more organized and easier to update. These changes didn’t change how the website looks but made it much cleaner behind the scenes. This part taught me how real developers write code that’s easy to read, maintain, and understand — not just code that works.


## How to View the Website
	1.	Open the project folder.
	2.	Go to the index.html file.
	3.	Right-click and select “Open with Browser” (e.g., Chrome or Edge).
	4.	Use the navigation menu to explore the other pages.
